# bixi_forecasting
I am attempting to forecast BIXI rides in 2020, which is going to be very challenging given the COVID-19 situation.

In this repository, you will find the R-code used to generate the BIXI 2020 rides' forecast. All of the data files needed to replicate the data analysis can also be found here. The step of appending the data has been skipped and not present in the R-code. The Montreal shape file can be downloaded here: City of Montreal: http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/polygones-arrondissements
